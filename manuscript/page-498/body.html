What shall I do? If it's true—what you say—you must go!" she said. "And you must never come any more. Do you promise that?"</p><p>"Certainly not," said the young man. "Why should I promise such a thing—so abominably wrong? I could obey if you didn't love me
"</p><p>"Oh, I don't! Indeed I don't! Now will you obey."</p><p>"No. I don't believe you." "Oh!"</p><p>He possessed himself of her hand again.</p><p>"My love—my dearest! What is this trouble, that you can't tell it? It can't be anything about yourself. If it is anything about any one else, it wouldn't make the least difference in the world, no matter what it was. I would be only too glad to show by any act or deed I could that nothing could change me towards you."</p></div> </div>
