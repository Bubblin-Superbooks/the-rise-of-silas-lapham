"But I shall not come to tea. I don't want anything. If I keep still, I shall be all right by morning."</p><p>"Well, I'm sorry," said the elder sister. "He's come down with father."</p><p>"He hasn't! Who?" cried Irene, starting up in simultaneous denial and demand.</p><p>"Oh, well, if you say he hasn't, what's the use of my telling you who?"</p><p>"Oh, how can you treat me so!" moaned the sufferer. "What do you mean, Pen?"</p><p>"I guess I'd better not tell you," said Penelope, watching her like a cat playing with a mouse. "If you're not coming to tea, it would just excite you for nothing."</p></div> </div>
