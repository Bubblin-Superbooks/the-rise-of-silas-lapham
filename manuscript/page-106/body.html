I don't know as his being dead would help it any. I can't ever see him without feeling just as I did at first."</p><p>"I tell you," said Lapham, "it was a perfectly square thing. And I wish, once for all, you would quit bothering about it. My conscience is easy as far as he is concerned, and it always was."</p><p>"And I can't look at him without feeling as if you'd ruined him, Silas."</p><p>"Don't look at him, then," said her husband, with a scowl.
