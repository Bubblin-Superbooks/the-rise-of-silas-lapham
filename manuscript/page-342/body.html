She did not read the open book that lay in her lap, though she kept her eyes fast on the print. Once she rose and almost shut the door, so that she could scarcely hear; then she opened it wide again with a self-disdainful air, and resolutely went back to her book, which again she did not read. But she remained in her room till it was nearly time for Corey to return to his boat.</p><p>When they were alone again, Irene made a feint of scolding her for leaving her to entertain Mr. Corey.</p><p>"Why! didn't you have a pleasant call?" asked Penelope.</p><p>Irene threw her arms round her. "Oh, it was a SPLENDID call! I didn't suppose I could make it go off so well. We talked nearly the whole time about you!"</p></div> </div>
